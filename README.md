# Back-end_E-Commerce

## Desciption
This application was developed with the mind set of allowing users to create a database consisting of arrays of information that is in this case Products, categories, and tags. With said data users could then create, read, update, and delete any and all information, so long as the information is available and they can find it. While scaffolding out this project I have better learned how to install packages, run data, and effectivley use Insomnia to determine the proper end points of my url and what possible errors could occur when trying to create, read, update, and delete data. At this point I am left with one question, "Going forward, how would I then develop future projects to integrate this back end as well as the front end?".
